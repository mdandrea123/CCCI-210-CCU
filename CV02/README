All files associated with our third CircuitVerse Assignment.

Description of the assignment:
finish the implementation of the simple ALU from Class on Sept 14, 2023.
Top level design (in main) should only include sub circuits for the 2-bit unsigned adder, 2-bit unsigned multiplier and also for the 4 2-1 1-bit multiplexors -- which of which should be designed and implemented as sub circuits.
Place inputs for A and B so that the are laid out in the standard left to right readable format, like what I mentioned in prior assignment , and also for the 4-bit output C.
Document all the design processes and steps in the report (WORD) and also submit.
You may use the combinational analysis tool to create the circuits, but all the work for the kmaps and truth tables must still be provided.
You can use screenshots from the truth tables in CV as part of the automated tool if you'd like.
If you can find a good k-map solver online, you maky also use them for the circles and also the MSOP equations.
Make sure that you can do what these tools do by hand still because on tests and quizzes, you will not have these tools.
In other works, use these tools to confirm that you know what you're doing.
Then submit the final report here. Also, remember, you have to do the CV02 assignment inside of the CSCI210 class group in CircuitVerse.
Make the circuit layout look professional in CV, and also make the report high quaility and explain what you're doing in there // document and screenshot.  Make it look nice and logical.

Note, you do not have to use the decoders we were talking about in class in this implementation, but if you find some cool way to do that, please do so -- but not required.
