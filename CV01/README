All files associates with our second CircuitVerse Assignment.

Description of the assignment:
Given that A and B are 2-bit unsigned integers and L is also unsigned, where L = A + B (integer addition). 
Create the truth table, all the k-maps, all the MSOP equations, and then implement, neatly, in CV (inside of the CSCI210-FA23 group --> CV01 assignment).

Take screenshots showing it working.
